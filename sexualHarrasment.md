## 1. What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment includes any unwelcome actions of a sexual nature that make someone uncomfortable, affect their work, or create a hostile environment. It can happen in three main ways:

* Verbal: This includes inappropriate comments about someone’s body, sexual jokes, asking for sexual favors, or spreading rumors about someone's personal life.
* Visual: This involves showing things like inappropriate pictures, cartoons, emails, or messages of a sexual nature.
* Physical: This includes unwanted physical actions like touching, hugging, or blocking someone’s way. It could even include behaviors like staring in a way that makes someone uncomfortable.
* There are also two types of sexual harassment:

Quid pro quo (this for that): This is when a boss or supervisor offers rewards (like promotions) or threatens punishments (like firing) to pressure someone into sexual acts.
Hostile work environment: This happens when repeated inappropriate behavior makes the workplace feel uncomfortable, scary, or offensive.
## 2. What would you do if I faced or witnessed any incident or repeated incidents of such behavior?

<b>If I face or witness sexual harassment, I could:</b>

* Speak up: If you feel safe, tell the person their behavior is unwelcome and needs to stop.
* Report it: Talk to a supervisor, HR, or someone you trust at work who can address the issue.
* Document it: Write down the details of what happened, including dates, times, and witnesses if there were any. This can help if you need to report it later.
* Seek support: Talk to friends, family, or a counselor for emotional support if needed.


## 1. Different scenarios enacted by actors:

<b>In training scenarios, actors often show examples of harassment to help people recognize different types. Some common situations might include:</b>

* Inappropriate jokes or comments: An actor makes repeated jokes about someone’s appearance, or tells sexual jokes that make others uncomfortable.
* Unwanted physical contact: An actor touches someone’s shoulder, hugs them without permission, or blocks their way.
* Requesting favors: A supervisor pressures an employee, offering job rewards if they agree to certain requests, or threatening consequences if they don’t.
* Visual harassment: An actor displays inappropriate pictures or messages in a public workspace where others can see them.
These scenarios help people identify harassment and show why certain behaviors create a negative work environment.

## 2. How to handle cases of harassment:

<b>If I experience or witness harassment:</b>

* Speak up: If you feel safe, let the person know their unwelcome behavior and ask them to stop.
* Report the incident: Talk to HR, a manager, or a trusted person at work who can help address the issue.
* Document details: Write down what happened, including dates, times, and any witnesses, so you have a record if needed.
* Seek support: Harassment can be upsetting, so talk to friends, family, or a counselor if needed for emotional support.
## 3. How to behave appropriately:

<b>To create a respectful workplace:</b>

* Be mindful of others: Avoid comments, jokes, or actions that could make others uncomfortable.
* Respect personal space: Don’t touch or stand too close to people unless you know they’re comfortable with it.
* Be professional in communications: Don’t share inappropriate jokes, messages, or images at work.
* Listen and respond: If someone tells you your behavior makes them uncomfortable, respect their request and adjust your behavior accordingly.
